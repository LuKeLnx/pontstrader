- Trailing Stop Loss
- Take Profit
- Stop Loss + Take Profit
- Trailing Take Profit

#### 10. Trailing Stop Loss (Requires 24/7 running device)
The trailing stop loss function allows you to trade currencies on a more advanced matter, if you do not know what trailing stop loss is please have a look at: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/trailing-stop-loss.asp

Upon selling a coin, either with loss or profit... a push notification will be send towards your phone if you've enabled pushover or pushbullet (which is awesome btw!)

Please keep in mind this function requires the system running this to be on 24/7, because this script will look for price differences every 0.5 seconds and is not able to do this when its not on. A recommendation will be a power efficient raspberry pi with for example Raspbian, you can run pontstrader is a screen or tmux session.

Small example:
If you set a trailing stop loss treshold to 10% your trade will immediately be sold when it falls 10% straight away, but if it climbs to 5% profit and afterwards falls 10% it will stop at -5% instead of minus 10%, this results in less loss.
If the price starts climbing and it goes towards 20%, the trailing stop loss will be set to 10%. When it starts falling it will sell on 10% which results in less risk and restless sleep for you :)

<img width="25%" height="25%" src="img/trailing2.png">

#### 11. Take Profit (Requires 24/7 running device)
The take profit function is actually the same as the Sell option, only the difference is that this script will keep track of the sell and notify you by a push message when the sell has happend.

Because the script is keeping track of the sell, you will need to run this on a device which is online 24/7.

<img width="25%" height="25%" src="img/takeprofit2.png">

#### 12. Stop Loss + Take Profit (Requires 24/7 running device)
The take profit function is actually the same as the Sell option, including a stop loss function which allows you to set not only one but both of them.

Same as the other 24/7 functions this function will notify you on changes through a push message.

<img width="25%" height="25%" src="img/stoplosstakeprofit2.png">

#### 13. Trailing + Take Profit (Requires 24/7 running device)
This function is the same as the trailing stop loss function, the only difference is... is that this function will never ever sell your coin when its down, it will only trigger a sell when the trailing stop loss threshold is in profit.
